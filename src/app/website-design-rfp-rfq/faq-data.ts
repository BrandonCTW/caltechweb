    q: "Do you respond to formal RFPs and RFQs?",
    a: "Yes. CalTech Web has been responding to website design RFPs and RFQs since 2015. We provide clear, concise proposals - typically 2-3 pages - that procurement teams can review and approve quickly. No 40-page documents filled with jargon.",

    q: "How does your $99/month model work for procurement budgets?",
    a: "Our flat-rate model simplifies procurement because there is no large capital expenditure to approve. $99/month is classified as an operating expense in most organizations. Many government agencies and non-profits can approve this without a full RFP process, though we are happy to participate in one.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you meet government compliance requirements?",

  {
    q: "What information do you need to respond to our RFP?",
    a: "Send us your RFP document or project requirements and we will provide a straightforward response within one business day. We need to understand your timeline, number of pages, any special features or integrations, and compliance requirements. Use the form above or email Brandon@CalTechWeb.com.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you require a multi-year contract?",
    a: "No. CalTech Web operates on a month-to-month basis. There are no annual contracts, no cancellation fees, and no vendor lock-in. If your organization requires a formal agreement, we can sign your standard vendor contract.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if we need to cancel or switch vendors?",
    a: "You can cancel anytime with no penalties. We provide all your website files so your organization is never left without a web presence. There is no data hostage situation - your content belongs to you.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you provide references from similar organizations?",
    a: "Absolutely. With 800+ websites delivered across government agencies, non-profits, churches, school districts, and businesses, we can provide references relevant to your industry and project scope.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you handle ongoing support and maintenance?",
    a: "Support is included in the $99/month. We have closed over 5,000 support tickets with 93% completed in under one hour. Your organization gets a direct line to Brandon - no ticket queues, no offshore support teams, no waiting days for a response.",
