    q: "What's Brandon's background in web design?",
    a: "Brandon has spent years building websites for small businesses, churches, and non-profits.

Today he oversees 800+ websites and personally reviews every site his team delivers.",

  {
    q: "Will I actually work with Brandon directly?",
    a: "Yes. Every CalTech Web client gets Brandon's direct email and cell number. He's personally involved in the design process and available for questions. You're never handed off to a call center or left waiting for a stranger to respond.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is working with Brandon different from hiring an agency?",
    a: "Most agencies charge $3,000-$10,000 upfront and then bill hourly for every small change.

No account managers, no ticket queues, no surprise invoices.",
  },
  {
    q: "What types of businesses does Brandon work with?",

    q: "What happens if I'm not happy with my website?",
    a: "Brandon offers a personal satisfaction guarantee: if you're not happy, you get a full refund and keep the website. No fine print, no hoops to jump through. He's maintained this policy since day one because he stands behind every site his team builds.",
